# For changes to the menu and other data

Make changes to data in `locations.json` and `menu.json`.

Some pieces of information are not in the json files. They will be in the `templates` folder. Make the changes in the template files.

Run `php build.php` to generate static site in `_site` folder.

# For anything else

You will need gulp.js installed.

Make changes to the source files (styl, html, js, etc) then run the `gulp` command from the command-line.
